# .NET MAUI and SkiaSharp

SkiaSharp is a 2D graphics system for .NET and C# powered by the open-source Skia graphics engine that's used extensively in Google products. You can use SkiaSharp in your .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps to draw 2D vector graphics, bitmaps, and text.

This sample demonstrates the use of SkiaSharp in a .NET MAUI app.
